# shopCart

Simple page with functionality of adjusting quantity of items in shop cart. After changing amount of products total sum for one row and for whole cart automatically updates. User can insert quantity manually in input element or, by clicking on buttons, add or remove from current amount. This small project was intented to make me familiar with basics of jQuery.
